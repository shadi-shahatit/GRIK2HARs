Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)

Reading sumstats from ASD_Grove2019.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 9112386 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 1807784 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
7304602 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (7304602 SNPs remain).
Using N = 18381.0
Median value of OR was 1.0001, which seems sensible.
